## Setup and Configuration:
* [Tello Drone](https://www.ryzerobotics.com/tello)
* ROS with Python 3
* [Vicon](https://github.com/ethz-asl/vicon_bridge)
* [Decentralized Formation Control](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6225196)
* PID Control
/Bunch of drones are used to form a specified shape(Mostly Characters). Shape Vectors between the drones are predefined and Control Commands are given to minimize the error between the shape vectors.
